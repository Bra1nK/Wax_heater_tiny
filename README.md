Wax_heater_tiny is an Arduino project to build a thermostatically controlled
heater. It is designed to use a ATtiny microprocessor instead of the usual
Arduino ATMEGA processors, so this will not work on a standard Arduino.

It makes use of the TinyWireM library for I2C communication. This library
can be found at
http://www.scenelight.nl/?wpfb_dl=22

It also uses the Tiny_LEDBackpack library found here:
